NGL is a small high level interpreted language written in Python.
The motivation behind NGL is to create a versatile and capable assembly-like
language that could be used as a target for other custom languages. I found
compilation into other assembly languages was very troublesome and hard to run
on my machine, so I decided to make my own assembly-like language I could
compile into.
